
This part of the tenebrae source tree deals with linux build. This file poorly documents the build procedure, so have a look in tenebrae forum for tips and work-around on this topic.


necessary stuff :

- Xfree 4.2
- nvidia kernel driver (the only one to provide the necessary OpenGL support).
- nvidia glx driver 
- mesa developpment stuff


This is a quite simple build procedure :

ln -s Makefile.i386linux Makefile
make 

By default, the program will consider /usr/local/share/games/quake as the directory where the id1 and tenebrae directories are to be found. You can change this by adding MASTER_DIR=<quake_dir> to the make command.

If everything goes right, you'll find the program in the debugi386.glibc/bin/ directory named tenebrae.run. Otherwise, you certainly got a lot of compilation errors dumped on your screen, so please, if it's an _official_ release, have a look at bug reports, forums, and if you don't find an answer, report the bug on the website. 



**** distributions specific stuff ****

- Gentoo : 

from their forum :

[...] I'd just like to remind you that I -had- to do "opengl-update xfree" for tenebrae to even start to compile and I couldn't run tenebrae until I had restarted X11 *AFTER* switching back to "opengl-update nvidia". Not sure if this applies to all cards or just nvidia. [...]
